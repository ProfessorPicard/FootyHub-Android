<h1>FootyHub Android Application</h1>
<p>An Android application created as part of my 2nd year at University of Brighton BSc Computer Science, that I am now turning into a fully fledged app.</p>
<p>Runs on any android device with API 28+</p>
<p>I would appreciate any bug reports if anyone decides to download and build this. 
  I have also created signed releases in the releases section for anyone wanting to just give it a go</p>

<h2>Special Requirements</h2>

<p>If you want to build and run this in android studio, you will need your own API key from https://www.football-data.org/</p>

<p>There is a free tier that allows good access and 10 API requests every minute.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add an api.properties file to the root of the project folder</li>
  <li>Add API_KEY variable with API key for https://www.football-data.org/ to the api.properties file</li>
  <li>Build and Run, should work fine after that</li>
</ul>
